# NLP 2024-2025 Project

This is the repo for the NLP 2024-2025 project of the team **CassanoGPT** composed by:
- Tommaso Giordano,
- Guido Gonnella,
- Andrea Migliorini,
- Simone Oggioni,
- Luca Olivieri.

This work investigates the application of various NLP technique ranging from data preprocessing, analysis, model fitting, LLM prompting and fine-tuning to a PubMedQA, a question-answering biomedical dataset presented in the scientific [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06146), and publicly available on [GitHub](https://pubmedqa.github.io) and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/qiaojin/PubMedQA).

**IMPORTANT**:
The `.html` notebook files might have some differences w.r.t. to their `.ipynb` counterparts since some of the notebooks had to be cleaned of their widgets in order to succesfully perform the conversion from `.ipynb` to `.html` (otherwise an exception was thrown).
